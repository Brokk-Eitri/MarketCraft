# Description
_An 'Economy-Simulation' plugin for Paper Minecraft 1.16.4/5_

Adds a shop that allows players to buy and sell items. The prices are calculated based on item rarity.
Players can also sell their own items, including enchants, for custom prices in the Player Shop.

Player's balances are tracked based on UUID, so username changes will not cause problems.
